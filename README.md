# libmosquitto-p

Free Pascal conversions of the libmosquitto header file `mosquitto.h`,
as part of the Eclipse Mosquitto project, and some Pascal examples
and language integration.

This allows using the libmosquitto MQTT client library, part of the
Mosquitto MQTT Broker project from Free Pascal applications.
